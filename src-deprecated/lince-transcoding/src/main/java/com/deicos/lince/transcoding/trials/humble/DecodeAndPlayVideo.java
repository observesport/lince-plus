 * Opens a media file, finds the first video stream, and then plays it.

 * Concepts introduced:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>MediaPicture: { MediaPicture} objects represent uncompressed video in Humble.</li>
 * <li>Timestamps: All { Media} objects in Humble have a timestamp, and this demonstration introduces the concept of having to worry about <i>when</i> to display information.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * To run from maven, do:

        *//**
         * Media playback, like comedy, is all about timing. Here we're going to introduce <b>very very basic</b>
         * timing. This code is deliberately kept simple (i.e. doesn't worry about A/V drift, garbage collection pause time, etc.)
         * because that will quickly make things more complicated.
         *
         * But the basic idea is there are two clocks:
         * <ul>
         * <li>Player Clock: The time that the player sees (relative to the system clock).</li>
         * <li>Stream Clock: Each stream has its own clock, and the ticks are measured in units of time-bases</li>
         * </ul>
         *
         * And we need to convert between the two units of time. Each MediaPicture and MediaAudio object have associated
         * time stamps, and much of the complexity in video players goes into making sure the right picture (or sound) is
         * seen (or heard) at the right time. This is actually very tricky and many folks get it wrong -- watch enough
         * Netflix and you'll see what I mean -- audio and video slightly out of sync. But for this demo, we're erring for
         * 'simplicity' of code, not correctness. It is beyond the scope of this demo to make a full fledged video player.
         *//*

        // Calculate the time BEFORE we start playing.

        *//**
         * Now, we start walking through the container looking at each packet. This
         * is a decoding loop, and as you work with Humble you'll write a lot
         * of these.
         *
         * Notice how in this loop we reuse all of our objects to avoid
         * reallocating them. Each call to Humble resets objects to avoid
         * unnecessary reallocation.
