front.consoleR.know.2=You have an available matrix to check your data from the R console. Try the \n next code to access the different data. Enter one of the following instructions and go through the R matrix as usual. \n If you have doubts, you can consult the following R \n documentation
front.consoleR.know.3=Unfortunately, in this console you can not execute the graphs of R. <br/> However, you can export everything you need through the tools you have in the "exports" section. <br/> So you can generate a file rData with the dump of information, or a CSV file.
front.consoleR.know.4=If you want to expand R to run additional libraries, try this command in the console directly. It installs all the libraries you need to work with Lince, including

front.home.label.advice=Lince pieces of advice
front.home.label.advice.1.title=About how it works
front.home.label.advice.1.msg=Lince Plus generates a web server every time it starts. This allows you to work as a team and each computer, tablet or phone of your local connection can access it using the IP of your machine, which you can see in the internet address above all. Remember that the port must be added and it changes every time.
front.home.label.advice.2.title=Statistics
front.home.label.advice.2.msg=This new version of Lince allows you to perform all the mathematical calculations you need. For this, it has built-in the core of the same R, which allows launching all the code you want. See the section 'Console R' to activate it.
front.home.label.advice.3.title=Video analysis
front.home.label.advice.3.msg=Do not worry on selecting more than one video for the analysis. But keep in mind that the first one you select is the most important, since it is used to record the times. Try that all videos have a similar duration so as not to make sampling mistakes. If a second video is longer than the first or master, you can only register up to the maximum length of the first one.
front.home.label.advice.4.title=Data privacy and disclaimer
front.home.label.advice.4.msg=The data you enter will be accessible only within your local network. If they were exposed, it would be due to a security breach, but, in principle, the data is only accessible from your workplace. The developers of Lince decline any type of responsibility that can be given for an improper use, such as using the mobile network of your telephone device or a public network of internet access, which may have security failures due to the infrastructure. Even so, if you detect improper behavior it is enough that you leave the program without saving the changes and when restarting the access address it will change and the previous data will be restored.
front.home.label.advice.5.title=Video compatibility
front.home.label.advice.5.msg=The fact of working on a browser limits us in some aspects and power in others, but only because of the change of concept. In order to maximize the compatibility between Apple, Linux and PC, web technology has been selected as it is the only one that allows Lynx software to run without many problems in any system. So please, re-encode your videos to work with them or continue using the old Lynx version for Windows.
front.home.label.legal=Legal information
front.home.label.legal.1.title=Legal not about multimedia files
front.home.label.legal.1.msg_1=Lince software uses tools with the latest open source and technology to allow you to make the personalized observations you need. You can see all the browser compatibility information here.
front.home.label.legal.1.msg_2=The compatibility with the various video formats is legal among others, so we can not support other formats not considered or obsolete.
front.home.label.legal.1.msg_3=If you can not work with these formats, you can transform the format you want and reproduce it on the desktop. There are several programs for this. If you do not know any, you can use EasyHtml5video.
front.home.label.legal.2.title=Disclaimer
front.home.label.legal.2.msg.1=Lince is a system made to facilitate observational tasks of a complex nature through behavioral observation. Arranged free of charge for the scientific community developed in collaboration with various universities in Spain.
front.home.label.legal.2.msg.2=The development of this software has been developed integrating open source tools and with a first level technological architecture, which allows the user to facilitate the research task.
